# TTVC (1994-1999)
The Tracker Visual C


These are the files belonging to an old project I did many years ago.

I started a tracker project on 1995 using Turbo Pascal. There is not much code from that age.
At this moment MSDOS usage was dying and Win95 was growing as the user choice for day to day personal computer tasks.

Thus I decided to port Techno Tracker to Windows. As the project was heavily based on Pascal, the best viable approach was to convert it to Borland Delphi development platform. And it was completelly ported to that, although some features were dropped during the process.

At that moment I was starting to learn c / c++, and I was sure this was going to be my main develpment language from this moment on. This was at the end of the 90's and now in 2023 c++ still is my main development language.

For this reason, I ported the program to Borland C++ Builder, but I was not really confortable with it because of stability problems, so I finally decided to port to plain Windows GDI and MFC using Visual C, instead.

This was the final version of the tracker.

Having explained all of this, you'll probably now understand why are there so many different files in the project folders. Many of those are just there for historical reasons, and are useless when building the binary exe.

There are some music compositions there in the directory songs.

After inspecting the code I saw something I completelly forgot: Code style is really horrible. All the function / methods are in Spanish (I don't know why, may be I wanted to promote my mother tongue or I was not confident enough at that moment so I decided to do this way).
